								<p>Hi! I'm Khadeejah, a student of Astronomy & Astrophysics from Pakistan. My research mainly lies in the field of Gamma-ray Bursts (GRBs), particularly propagation and relativistic effects in outflows. 
							<p>I completed my B.S. in Space Science from the Institute of Space Technology, Islamabad in 2020 and was the recipient of the Vice Chancellor's gold medal for best final year thesis. I also worked as a volunteer science teacher at several government schools and participated in space outreach workshops with the startup Cosmic Space Systems.</p>
							<p>Currently, I am a Research Assistant at the Space and Astrophysics Research Lab (SARL). My work here has been largely focused on GRBs.</p>

								<b>High-latitude Emission in Gamma-ray Bursts: studying propagation effects</b><br> Relativistic outflows in Gamma-ray Bursts (GRBs) are collimated into jets with narrow angles due to the beaming effect. In simple kinetic models, these jets are composed of relativistic, emitting shells with spherical geometry causing a propagation effect: emission that abruptly stops results in the observed flux decaying with time, rather than immediately ceasing. We study the propagation effect in isolation by generating random, uniform emission from the surface of a static shell. We then simulate emission profiles and study the corresponding observed profiles. Time-varying emission is seen to be delayed by a time scale that is consistent with the angular spreading time scale found in literature. In particular, we find that the presence of flux variations in the observed profile depends on the size of the emission region relative to the time scale of pulses in the emission profile.<br>An initial paper has been submitted to the ICASE <a href="https://ncgsa.org.pk/icase">ICASE</a>conference in Islamabad, Pakistan.
