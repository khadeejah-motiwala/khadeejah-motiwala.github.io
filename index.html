								<p>Hi! I'm Khadeejah, a Research Assistant at the <a href="https://ncgsa.org.pk/space-and-astrophysics-research-lab-sarl/"> Space and Astrophysics Research Lab (SARL)</a> in Islamabad, Pakistan. My research mainly lies in the field of Gamma-ray Bursts (GRBs), particularly propagation and relativistic effects in ejecta. I am also interested in numerical methods of studying outflows from Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs). </p>
							<p>I completed my B.S. in Space Science from the Institute of Space Technology, Islamabad in 2020 and was the recipient of the Vice Chancellor's gold medal for best final year thesis. </p>
							<p>Science outreach is one of my passions; I have worked as a volunteer science teacher at several government schools and conducted space outreach workshops. In my free time, I love to travel to the North of Pakistan and photograph the cosmos.</p>

								<b>High-latitude Emission in Gamma-ray Bursts: studying propagation effects</b><br> Relativistic outflows in Gamma-ray Bursts (GRBs) are collimated into jets with narrow angles due to the beaming effect. In simple kinetic models, these jets are composed of relativistic, emitting shells with spherical geometry causing a propagation effect: emission that abruptly stops results in the observed flux decaying with time, rather than immediately ceasing. We study the propagation effect in isolation by generating random, uniform emission from the surface of a static shell (click <a href="https://github.com/khadeejah-motiwala/RandomUniSphere"> here</a> to see how we achieved this. We then simulate emission profiles and study the corresponding observed profiles. Time-varying emission is seen to be delayed by a time scale that is consistent with the angular spreading time scale found in literature. In particular, we find that the presence of flux variations in the observed profile depends on the size of the emission region relative to the time scale of pulses in the emission profile.<br>An initial paper has been submitted to the <a href="https://ncgsa.org.pk/icase">ICASE</a> 2021 conference in Islamabad, Pakistan.

								<b>Simulating the relativistic beaming effect in emission from gamma-ray burst ejecta.</b><br>In astrophysical sources with relativistic jets such as gamma-ray bursts or active
galactic nuclei, a commonly encountered problem is that of transforming the luminosity
from the comoving frame of reference of the jet to the observer frame of reference.
Such calculations are usually carried out through Doppler transformation of quantities
between the two frames of reference in the framework of radiative transfer theory.
In this work, we show that equivalent results can be obtained by working with
the probability density functions of photons or rays emitted at verions angles in both
frames of reference. We first carry out the Doppler transformation for an isotropic
emission in the comoving frame of reference and obtain well-known <a href=images/isotropic.png> results</a> obtained
from tranforming the luminosity. We also extend this method to a limb-darkened
emission in the comoving frame of reference to obtain the emission probability density
function in the observer frame of reference.

								<b>Calculating errors in GRB spectral energy distributions (SEDs)</b><br>The application of empirical functions to the analysis of gamma-ray burst (GRB) spectra plays
an important role in understanding their fundamental nature. These functions, called spectral models, are fitted to spectral energy distributions (SEDs). <p>We develop a software tool which calculates and plots errors in Spectral Energy
Distributions (SEDs) in Gamma-ray Burst analyses. The tool inputs FITS files which contain
the results of spectral fits, obtained from RMfit. In particular, the tool utilizes the covariance
matrix which contains covariances of correlated parameters of a particular spectral model. The
tool's output is a SED butterfly plot with complete error propagation. Click <a href="https://github.com/khadeejah-motiwala/SEDErrorCalculationTool"> here</a> to look at the GitHub repository for the tool. </p>

								<b>Community Service:</b> As an undergrad, I realized that a long-term goal of mine was to be a science educator for children in Pakistan. I regularly volunteered at <a href="https://www.facebook.com/weshallchange/">UMEED</a>, a brilliant non-profit organisation started by university students for students from low-income families, enrolled in government schools with dismal resources. From 2016 to 2020 (halted due to COVID), we conducted regular visits to government schools in the Rawat dristrict of Rawalpindi, where we gave talks on science and the environment.

								<b>Astrophotography:</b> My family and I love to travel to the North of Pakistan - a region canopied by the Himalayan, Karakoram, and Hindu Kush mountain ranges. By day, the mountains provide the perfect opportunity for a postcard photo but at night, far, far away from any city lights, they blend into the dark sky. You wouldn't be able to tell where the peaks end and the heavens begin, if not for the latter being completely engulfed by the Milky Way. <br> I drag a cousin (I'm scared of ghosts) into the black, chilly night and force him to strain his neck upward with me. Up at the only sources of illumination for miles around us, until our necks cramp up. My DSLR is pointed upward too, but thankfully the tripod can take the weight.
